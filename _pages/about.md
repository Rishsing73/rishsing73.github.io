I am a PhD student at the **Ebitz lab, University of Montreal**, focusing on how the brain works, specifically in non-human primates. I'm midway through my PhD (hello, mid-PhD crisis!) and navigating the rollercoaster of experimental failures. While my heart lies in neuroscience, my interests span across reinforcement learning, colonial history, and wealth distribution.

Here are some highlights of my research questions. If you want to dive deeper, check out my projects page. I believe we always ask three types of questions - What, How, and Why:

ðŸ§  **WHAT?** I give tiny electrical stimulations to specific brain regions and try to understand how the neural system responds to these disturbances - kind of like poking a complex machine to see how it works!

ðŸ§  **HOW (with math)?** To make sense of it all, we need mathematical models. I'm diving into various theoretical frameworks to find which ones least wrongly explain the mechanisms of exploration - a small step towards a unifying theory.

ðŸ§  **WHY?** I'm fascinated by why the brain evolved these specific mechanisms for exploration, though this evolutionary perspective might be beyond the scope of my PhD (one can dream, right?).
