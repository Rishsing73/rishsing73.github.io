# Welcome to My Website ğŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at **McGill University**, focusing on neuroscience and decision-making.

ğŸ”¹ I use **computational modeling and electrophysiology** to study reinforcement learning.  
ğŸ”¹ My research explores how primates decide between **exploring and exploiting** rewards.  
ğŸ”¹ I am collaborating with leading neuroscientists at **McGill University**.

## **Research Interests**
