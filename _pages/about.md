I am a PhD student at the <span class="highlighted">Ebitz lab, University of Montreal</span>, focusing on how the brain works, specifically in non-human primates. I'm midway through my PhD (hello, mid-PhD crisis!) and navigating the rollercoaster of experimental failures. While my heart lies in neuroscience, my interests span across reinforcement learning, colonial history, and wealth distribution.

Here are some highlights of my research questions. If you want to dive deeper, check out my projects page. Inspired by David Marr's influentiasl framework, I frame my research around three core questionsâ€”<span class="highlighted">What, How, and Why</span>â€”each reflecting <span class="highlighted">Marr's</span> distinct analytical levels:

ðŸ§  <span class="highlighted">WHAT? (Implementational Level)</span> I deliver targeted electrical stimulations to specific brain regions, much like testing individual components of a complex system to see how each contributes to overall function. This implementational approach helps me uncover direct causal relationships between neural circuits and behavior. My recent interest lies in how these interventions affect decisions to exploit known rewards or explore novel options, illuminating underlying neural processes such as attention, motivation, and memory.

ðŸ§  <span class="highlighted">HOW? (Algorithmic Level)</span> I employ computational models to interpret and decode complex neural data, akin to reverse-engineering the internal logic of a sophisticated computer program. Cognitive processes like exploration and exploitation span multiple brain regions and dynamic interactions; thus, I use mathematical frameworks inspired by dynamical systems and artificial intelligence to track the algorithmic progression of these decision-making behaviors over time.

ðŸ§  <span class="highlighted">WHY? (Computational Level)</span> At the deepest level, I ask why evolution selected these particular cognitive strategies. What adaptive problems shaped our brain's tendency to balance safe choices with occasional leaps into uncertainty? While addressing these computational-level evolutionary questions extends beyond my immediate PhD scope, this perspective fundamentally influences how I view cognitionâ€”not merely as neural activity, but as optimized solutions shaped by the ecological demands encountered over evolutionary time.
